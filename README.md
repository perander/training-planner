## training-planner

A study project for the university course on databases.

With this program, a user can browse, subscribe and mark as done different kinds of training tasks or challenges. The tasks are organized hierarchically so that for a task X, there can be a set of subtasks, so-to-say prerequisites for the task X. Then, for each of the subtasks, there can be again a set of subtasks, etc. This is supposed to make planning easier, since in order to attain larger goals a user can see how to split them into smaller, easier tasks.

You can find a more detailed description about the topic [here](./documentation/description.md) and about the database [here](./documentation/aboutdatabase.md).
